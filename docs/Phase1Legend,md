# Refactoring Roadmap & Phase Strategy

## Order of Operations

- ✅ **PHASE 1** — Public HTML → React  
  *(you’ve DONE this)*

- 🔜 **PHASE 2** — Public layout + shared components  
  *(this is next)*

- ⏭️ **PHASE 3** — Internal app refactor (Investor / Originator / Admin)

- 🚀 **PHASE 4** — Product hardening (permissions, performance, UX)

> **Important:** Anything earlier than **PHASE 3** is risky for internal pages.

## Why Internal Pages MUST Wait

Internal pages are **fundamentally different** from public pages.

### Public pages are:

- Mostly static
- Marketing / informational
- SEO-oriented
- Low state complexity
- Few permissions

### Internal pages are:

- State-heavy
- Auth-dependent
- Role-based
- Data-driven (API, charts, tables)
- Error-prone if refactored prematurely

**If you refactor them before the public layer stabilizes:**

- Layout decisions will change underneath you
- Auth & routing assumptions may break
- You’ll redo work when roles diverge

## PHASE-BY-PHASE CLARITY

### ✅ PHASE 1 (DONE)

**Goal:** Parity, not elegance

- HTML → React conversion
- One-file pages allowed
- No abstraction
- No shared layouts

→ You executed this correctly.

### 🔜 PHASE 2 (NEXT)

**Scope:** Public surface **only**

You will:

- Introduce `PublicLayout.tsx`
- Extract:
  - NavBar
  - Footer
  - Possibly CTA / FAQ primitives
- Apply to **public pages only**

**🚫 Explicitly excluded:**

- Investor dashboard
- Originator onboarding flows
- Admin panels

### 🧱 PHASE 3 (INTERNAL REFACTOR)

This is where **Investor**, **Originator**, and **SuperAdmin** pages belong.

**Why PHASE 3?**  
By then:

- Public layout is stable
- Routing patterns are proven
- Auth model is clearer

You can safely introduce:

- `AppLayout.tsx`
- `InvestorLayout.tsx`
- `OriginatorLayout.tsx`
- `AdminLayout.tsx`

You refactor **with intent**, not guesswork.

#### Recommended PHASE 3 Order (Very Important)

**Do not refactor all roles at once.**

1. **Step 1 — Investor** (Lowest Risk)  
   - Most read-only views  
   - Portfolio, transactions, documents  
   - Few destructive actions

2. **Step 2 — Originator**  
   - Forms  
   - Uploads  
   - Status workflows  
   - More state complexity

3. **Step 3 — SuperAdmin** (Last)  
   - Global permissions  
   - Overrides  
   - Data mutation  
   - Highest blast radius

## What You Should NOT Do Yet ❌

- Don’t share layouts between public & internal
- Don’t extract auth logic prematurely
- Don’t optimize dashboards for performance yet
- Don’t normalize UI tokens yet

→ Those belong to **PHASE 4**.
